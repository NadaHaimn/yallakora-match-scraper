# YallaKora Match Details Web Scraper

This Python script scrapes match details from YallaKora based on a user-specified date. It extracts data such as team names, scores, match times, and championship titles, and exports the data into a CSV file. The script uses the requests library to fetch web pages, BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library for parsing HTML, and csv for writing the scraped data into a CSV file.

## Features

- **Scrapes Championship Titles**: Extracts the title of the championship for each match.
- **Scrapes Team Names**: Extracts the names of the teams playing in each match.
- **Scrapes Match Time**: Extracts the scheduled time for the match.
- **Scrapes Match Scores**: Extracts the final scores for each match.
- **Date-Based Scraping**: Users can input a specific date to fetch match data from that day.
- **CSV Export**: Saves the scraped data into a CSV file for easy analysis and storage.

## Customization

- **Change Date**: You can modify the date format in the input or script to scrape data for different dates.
- **Additional Fields**: The script is designed to scrape core match details, but you can modify it to include additional fields as needed.

## Limitations

- **Dynamic Content**: The script may not function correctly if YallaKora changes its HTML structure.
- **Rate Limiting**: Frequent scraping may lead to your IP being blocked. Consider adding delays between requests if scraping large amounts of data.
